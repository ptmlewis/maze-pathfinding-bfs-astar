# 🧩 Maze Pathfinding using BFS and A*

## 🧠 Overview
Solves 2D maze navigation problems using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A\*** algorithms.  
Compares path length, cost, and execution time between uninformed and heuristic search.

## ⚙️ Features
- Supports text-file maze input (S=start, G=goal, #=wall)  
- Visualizes explored cells and shortest path  
- Manhattan heuristic for A\* search  
- Handles unsolvable mazes gracefully

## 🚀 Run
```bash
python maze_pathfinding_bfs_astar.py
```

## 🧩 Example Output
```
BFS Path Length: 18 | Time: 0.0032s
A*  Path Length: 18 | Time: 0.0011s
```
